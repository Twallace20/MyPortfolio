## Purposes of Portfolio

This portfolio was made to highlight a few of my skills and keep all who view it engaged ! This showcase illustrates a small portion of my knowledge in coding! While attending FlatIron the most valuable skill I gained was the ability to learn quickly. I appreciate the challange and triumph in handling issues. I hope you can enjoy what I put together for you ðŸ˜€
